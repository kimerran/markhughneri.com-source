This is `Mark Hugh B. Neri`

A software developer from Manila, Philippines. I write about code and hiking in the Philippines on this blog.

## Passion for building things
I am an engineer. I build things through code and software. 


## Passion for nature and helping others

I recently found love in hiking - it teaches me humility. [We](http://www.facebook.com/teampasitib) also help others through outreach activities.

Here's a picture of our camp at Lake Tabeyo at the base of Mt. Tabayoc, Kabayan, Benguet after our outreach at Mongoto Elem. School.

It's more fun in the Philippines!
