title: Luzon 3-2 Outreach at Mongoto Elem. School (Day 1)
---

It was back in April when a friend of mine requested to organize an outreach hike for her birthday. And having visited Mongoto Elem. School during the holy week, I suggested her that place. She agreed and we originally scheduled the event at May but unfortunately, students are still on vacation during that time and so we re-scheduled the outreach on June.

Two months prior to the activity, we have asked friends and co-mountaineers for pledges and donations as we will be giving a set of school supplies for 70 students of Mongoto Elem. School. The set will include a bag, pencils, and papers that they can use during this school year. Aside from the donations we asked from our friends, I have organized a training climb for the participants as our itinerary involves climbing up Mt. Tabayoc – Luzon’s 2nd highest peak and as well as hiking the mystical lakes of Kabayan.

## Highest Point of the Philippine Highway System

We took the 11 PM bus bound to Baguio and arrived before 5 AM. Our driver Kuya Eddie is already waiting for us near the Victory Liner terminal. We just bought our tickets (Baguio-Manila) and bought some supplies before we left Baguio City. We took a short stop-over at the Highest Point of the Philippine Highway System for some photo-ops.

## Mongoto Elementary School

The highlight of our itinerary is the giving away of the school supplies for the students. As we give each one their gifts, some students dance to the tune of “Gummy Bear”. We do have a personal favorite – Yanyan who is very bubbly and sweet. The experience of giving touches not only the hearts of the students and the principal – Mrs. Marcos but also the hearts of our participants, some of who did this kind of activity for the first time.

## Mt. Timbak (Luzon’s 3rd Highest Peak)
After the outreach activity, we started hiking Mt. Timbak which is about 20-30 minutes walk from Mongoto Elem. School. A guide is not necessary climbing the summit, you just need to ask around the locals. The group took some pictures at the calvary and decided to descend after some few minutes.

## Timbak Mummy Caves

Just a few minutes from the school, you can reach the jump-off point of Timback Mummy Caves where you need to get a guide. The location of the mummy caves is about 5-10 minutes short hike from the jump-off. The last time we went there, the guide opened the casket to show us the actual mummies. Unfortunately this time, the guides were instructed by the National Museum to avoid showing the mummies due to evidence of deterioration. So, we just took some photos and respected the instructions.
