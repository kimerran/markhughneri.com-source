## Hype-Drive Development

I like shiny new things. There are those programmers that's always wanted to try out the latest and greatest tools out there. Two reasons - it could help solve problems much easier than what currently is being used or companies might migrate to these new stuff and better come prepared when they do.

And I am one of those.

## Enter Elixir

I tried learning functional programming but the material I tried to learn from is so "mathematical". Can't blame it since it should be, well, mathematical in nature.

I am not sure how I got myself introduced to Elixir - perhaps due to YouTube's related video content. I was actually trying to learn highly distributed systems using the Actor model in .NET.

Though it is a functional programming language, Elixir is less painful to learn. As several authors and speakers say - *"It brings joy to development much like Ruby".*

`Elixir = Joy + Functional + Highly Concurrent + Highly Reliable`

And so, here I am, totally sold to the idea that "[Elixir Will Soon Conquer the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X25xOhntr6s)".

## What I do to learn
 * Watch a lot of YouTube videos - [ElixirConf](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=elixir+conf)
 * Online resources (aside from Elixir Lang Docs and Hex package docs)
    * [Elixir Forum](https://elixirforum.com/)
    * [/r/elixir](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/)
    * [Elixir Lang Slack](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/)

## Some investments
While there are free resources in the internet, I did bought some resources as well.

* [Programming Phoenix Ebook ($23)](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix)

* [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp (Udemy) ($10)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/)

## Fingers crossed

Few years ago I did a same blog post on an attempt to learn Ruby and Rails framework. Fast-forward today, I am attempting to learn a "similar" language. And hoping that in a few years Elixir will become mainstream as demands for highly concurrent and connected devices are becoming higher.

Hope to return here someday and tell myself - "guest I'm right".
