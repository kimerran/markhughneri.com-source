title: Luzon 3-2 Outreach at Mongoto Elem. School (Day 2)
---

This is the day 2 of our Luzon 3-2 Outreach. Read about Day 1 [here](http://markhughneri.com/2016/07/12/luzon-32-outreach-mongoto-elem-school/).

## Lake Tabeyo at Ballay, Kabayan

After giving out school supplies and a quick hike to summit of Mt. Timbak and a visit to the mummy caves, our plan is to set camp at Lake Tabeyo at Ballay, Kabayan. So after we visited the mummy caves, we took the road down to Kabayan Bario. What took me and Joren almost half a day when we did it by foot was only 30 minutes by monster jeep. We reached Ballay, Kabayan an hour before the sun sets. So, we have enough time to set camp while there’s day light and immediately proceeded to prepare our dinner.

## The “Stormy” Night

The original plan is to climb Mt. Tabayoc as early as 4 AM and get down by lunch so we can all visit the remaining three of four mystical lakes of Kabayan. Unfortunately, the weather forbids us to do that. The strong winds even broke one of the tents and forced some of us to sleep at the jeepney. It rained during the whole night and became very foggy during the time we planned to start the hike. The guides as well recommended that we do not proceed.

## Team Tabayoc

The weather got better at around 7 in the morning. Now, we don’t have enough time to cover both Mt. Tabayoc assault and visiting the mystical lakes. So, as a Plan B, I decided to break the team into two teams – one team will assault Mt. Tabayoc while the other will hike mystical lakes. The team agreed to this and agreed that the team that will visit the mystical lakes and Jr. Pulag need to go back earlier to prepare lunch.

## Team Mystical Lakes

The other team (including me) started shortly after Team Tabayoc left. We need to finish the hike for about 3 hours and needed to go back to campsite to prepare lunch. The team enjoyed the chilly weather while hiking Jr. Pulag and visiting the three other lakes namely – Incolos, Latep-Ngapos and Ambulalakao lakes. Some of us even “took a dip” in one of those lakes. Can you guess who among us did? LOL.

## The road to Baguio City Sidetrips

While on your way back to Baguio City from Ballay, Kabayan, Benguet, we visited several places such as the Opdas Burial Cave, Daclan Sulfur Spring, Jangjang Bridge and the Ambuklao Dam.

## 2 Days Well Spent

It might be short but the two days we spent at Atok and Kabayan, Benguet was really worth it. We achieved our goal of delivering the school supplies to the deserving students of Mongoto Elem. School and was able to appreciate beauty of which I consider one of the most beautiful places here in the Philippines.

Aside from that, we are able to build stronger relationships among our mountaineer friends where we have started to label the group as Team Pasitib. Looking forward to more fruitful events with the team!
