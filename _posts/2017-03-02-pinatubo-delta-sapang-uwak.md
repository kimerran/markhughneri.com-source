title: An account on Mt. Pinatubo hike via Delta - Sapang Uwak (Rosary Circuit Trail)

## A must-try (not for beginners)
February 25-26, 2017. Rated with a difficulty of 8/9, I have come not very prepared for this hike. The only things that I did as training are a dayhike of Mt. Batulao (2 loops) and some easy jogging in the afternoon after work.

## Orientation
Like any other major climb, we are time bound to reach certain areas. Originally, the plan is to reach the camp site before dawn but because we started out late and one of our members got injured, we decided to pitch our tents at the emergency camp.

Sir Jerry mentioned that if we are able to reach the campsite, our second day will be easier but since that didn't happened, our second day will be more difficult and lengthy than day 1.

## What to expect
The start is a long gradual ascent in and out of forests until you reach the dense forest where you will begin rope-assisted descents. On this part will start some parts with rocks and sands as well.

After this area, you will begin your trek to start of so many river crossings where some parts you need to climb big boulders. After those big boulders, a very long trek along the Delta River to the falls is next. We reached the falls by lunch time and took our lunch there.

## Going up and down to emergency camp
The next part is an assault up and another rope-assisted descent where the emergency camp near the river awaits. We reached the area around 2-3 PM and pitched our tent. We plan to start very early the next day so we prepared dinner earlier.

# Day 2
Woke up around 3 in the morning, ate our breakfast and started trek at around 5:30 AM. The start is another trek in the river, so get ready to get your feet wet very early in the morning. One must also be careful in his steps as rocks are very slippery.

It's another gradual ascent on rocky trails where a part of it you will be able to see Mt. Arayat. The rocky trail ends when you need another rope-assisted ascent that will be a start of a single trail where one can easily be outbalanced due to some parts are densely covered with plants and grass and the branches that you can hold are full of thorns.

## Crater climb
After the challenging forest part, you will now start the climb on the crater. The clouds started to engulf us that we started praying for a clearing once we reach the summit - and then we arrived at the summit where you can view the whole crater lake. Of course, your visit to Mt. Pinatubo is not complete without some pictures with the lake on the background.

## Down the crater
Similar to he trails we used climbing up the crater, deep ravines awaits us as we go down the crater. We are now on our way to "Mc-Do" area where we will take our lunch. During my descent, I felt very tired and lost my energy.

## Up again
Before you reach the "Mc-Do" campsite, you need to climb again a very steep portion. This is the time the I took a short nap and ate some trail food since my body is not cooperating anymore. Some regarded the trail up this portion as "Akiki-like" assault.

## Lunch at Mc-Do 
Finally, I arrived at the Mc-Do area where the team is already starting to prepare our lunch. It was one big lunch (we do have lots of food). We take time to eat and rest before we start again our descent. It is still a long way to go down.

## Easy but very long descent
Though I am still challenged going down any trails, the trail going down is easy enough to navigate. It's just the momentary assaults that takes away your energy and can slow you down. I am at the end of the group. Guess I did the right decision to negotiate a "habal-habal" ride so I don't extend the time further waiting for me.

## Finally
You know you are near the finish line when you reached the area that completes the circuit. While we go down the trail, we are fetched by the "habal-habal" ride which is actually not for us but still decided to take us since the ones who called them haven't arrived yet.

## Extreme Ride Down
I decided to take the remaining 1-2 Km on "habal-habal". The "habal-habal" experience adds up to our extreme adventure. While on our way down, we volunteered to carry our pals' bags so they can descend easier and offered some remaining water suppy as well.

## 8:20 PM
At around 8:20 PM, all reached the jump-off point and finished the circuit trail. Boodle fight awaits us prepared by Sapang Uwak chieftain, Kap Zeny who prepared Tinola and Inihaw na Bangus for us.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to Sir Mel Bryan for organizing such an adventure experience and to Sir Jherry Guiao, our climb coordinator. Kapitan Zeny, Sapang Uwak chieftain for support and dinner. And of course to our guides who remained patient and strong all throughout the climb.
